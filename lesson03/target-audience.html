        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <h3>Where can I access the weather information from?</h3>
        <p>Weather Works is formatted for both desktop and mobile users, making it easy to both plan ahead and make decisions on the go.</p>
        <h3>Is this information coming from a meteorologist?</h3>
        <p>Online weather forecasts are based on a network of detection tools and weather radar pictures and models. The data generation is for the most part automated.</p>
        <h3>Does the site have information on my town?</h3>
        <p>Weather Works draws its information from national meteorological data, but the site’s focus is southeast Idaho, specifically the areas of Preston, Soda Springs, 
            and Fish Haven.</p>
        <h3>Can I get weather information for a place that is outside of town?</h3>
        <p>The weather predictions will typically be fairly accurate for areas surrounding a specific city or town. Higher elevation areas outside of town will typically 
            be cooler, and we will try to provide relevant info to those type of situations.</p>
        <h3>Can I get weather information for a different day?</h3>
        <p>Weather Works provides forecasts using meteorological data which typically extends to 10 days. No forecast is perfect, and conditions can change at a moment’s 
            notice, but the information provided here is typically helpful in the overall view.</p>
