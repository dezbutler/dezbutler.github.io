            <p>There are a few ways that using design to filter choices is demonstrated on this page. While this website offers a variety of products, we are already on a page that is only meant to show one type of product (CPUs). On a bar above the product list, you also find a drop down menu which enables users to sort the list by different relevant metrics such as price or popularity. Next to that is an actual filter button, where users can narrow down their search by only showing products that fall within certain categories, such as product line or manufacturer or feature.</p>
